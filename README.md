# SMS Spam Classifier

This project is a simple web application to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam) using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. 
The model is trained using the TF-IDF vectorizer. 
The web application is built using Flask and includes a front-end interface with a text area to enter the message and a button to validate the message.
